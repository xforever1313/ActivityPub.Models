# ActivityPub.Models

This is a library that has various models from [ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub) that I use for my various web sites.

This is NOT nor does it intend to be a full implementation of ActivityPub, just the parts I use.  For this reason, it is not recommended to use this in a true production environment.

## ARCHIVED, DO NOT USE

Please use the [ActivityStreams](https://github.com/KristofferStrube/ActivityStreams) library by [Kristoffer Strube](https://github.com/KristofferStrube) instead.

If you need a version that targets .NET 6, I have a [forked version](https://github.com/xforever1313/ActivityStreams).

## Usage

There is no NuGet package.  Either clone this repo as a submodule, or copy/paste the source code into your project.  There is included a shared project and a .csproj, depending on what it is you're trying to do.  If adding the .csproj, you'll have to add both the shared project and the .csproj to your solution, not just one or the other.
